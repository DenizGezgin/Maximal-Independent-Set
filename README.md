# Maximal-Independent-Set
Intuitively, independent set of a graph is a set of vertices of a graph in which no two vertices are adjacent to each other. Maximal independent set of a graph is the independent set with the largest number of vertices. Formally, an independent set S of graph G = (V, E) is a subset S of V such that no two vertices in S are joined
by an edge in E. An independent set that is not a proper subset of another independent set is called maximal or maximum. As a result the maximal independent set of a graph is the largest cardinality subset W of V such that no two vertices in in W is joined by an edge in E.

Decision version of maximal independent set problem is NP-complete. However maximal independent set problem is considered to be NP-Hard
This paper aims to cover heuristic and brute force alghortims relating to maximal independent set problem along with both performence and corretness testing for the solutions.
